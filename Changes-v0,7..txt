Version 0.7
1. Support for simultaneous operation of up to two TUN interfaces. This will be useful if, for example, you want to direct the traffic of some devices through sing-box according to the rules specified in the sing-box configuration file, while directing the traffic of other devices entirely to the proxy tunnel.
2. Added command:
sbs check
This function is built into the sing-box core and is used to check the correctness of the sing-box configuration file (config.json). It does not detect all errors, but in most cases, it helps a lot in finding them. As a result, it shows the first found error with its line and column number in config.json. Then, to fix the error, you are prompted to open config.json in the nano editor. After fixing and finishing editing, the next error, if any, is found, and you are again prompted to fix it in the nano editor. This repeats until you fix all errors or decide to stop by refusing to edit the next error.
3. Added command:
sbs format
This function is built into the sing-box core and is used to give config.json a readable structure as intended by the sing-box developer. First, like sbs check, the sbs format command checks config.json for errors. If errors are found, formatting will be impossible until you fix them all. After fixing all errors, the configuration file structure will be optimized, the result will be displayed in the console, and you will be prompted to save it to your config.json.
4. Minor bug fixes.

To upgrade from version 0.6 to version 0.7:
Save your config.json file located in the /jffs/addons/sing-box-script directory (this directory will be deleted along with the /opt/root/sing-box directory).
Remove version 0.6 using the command in the router's console:
sbs remove
Install version 0.7 by running the following command in the router's console:
wget -O /jffs/scripts/sbs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dr4tez/sing-box4asus/main/sbs && chmod 775 /jffs/scripts/sbs && /jffs/scripts/sbs install
Set up the script with the command in the router's console:
sbs setup
At this point, you can edit the new preset config.json template or edit your config.json after placing it in the /jffs/addons/sing-box-script directory, as it is now possible to use two TUN interfaces simultaneously, and the template has been slightly modified for this purpose.
